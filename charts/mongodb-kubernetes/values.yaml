    # Setting false:

    #  - The operator will not create the service for the webhook. If the `operator-webhook` service was created before, it will be deleted.
    #  - The operator will still expose the webhook's endpoint on port on MDB_WEBHOOK_PORT (if not specified, the operator uses a default 1993) in case the ValidatingWebhookConfigurations is configured externally (e.g. in OLM/OpenShift) or by the administrator manually.
